## Getting Started
1. Create `client/.env` and add the `REACT_APP_AIRTABLE_API_KEY` and `REACT_APP_AIRTABLE_BASE` environment variables to it.
1. `cp backend/.env.example backend/.env`
1. Install `node_modules` in both the `client` and `backend` folders using the latest version of Node 12. This allows
for the `node_modules` on the host to be seen by the Docker container, and also avoids the need to rebuild the container whenever a new dependency is added.
1. Run `docker-compose up` and goto `localhost:3000` in the browser.
