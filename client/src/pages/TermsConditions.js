                The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the
                Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
                Association (“AAA”) and, where appropriate, the AAA’s
                Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (“AAA
                Consumer Rules”), both of which are available at the{" "}
                <TermsLink href="https://www.adr.org/">AAA website</TermsLink>.
                The determination of whether a Dispute is subject to arbitration
                shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. The parties
                agree that the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to
                decide all issues relating to the interpretation, applicability,
                enforceability and scope of this arbitration agreement. Your
                arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall
                be governed by the AAA Rules and, where appropriate, limited by
                the AAA Consumer Rules. The arbitration may be conducted, at the
                option of the claimant, either in person or by video conference.
                The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not
                provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. The
                arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be
                challenged within a reasonable period of time (not to exceed 30
                days) if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except as otherwise
                provided in this Agreement, you and the Company may litigate in
                court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending
                arbitration or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on
                the award entered by the arbitrator. Judgment upon any award
                rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered and enforcement
                obtained thereon in any court having jurisdiction. All
                arbitration proceedings shall be closed to the public and
                confidential and all records relating thereto shall be
                permanently sealed, except as necessary to obtain court
                confirmation of the arbitration award. Each party shall have the
                right to participate by video conference in order to minimize
                travel and expense burdens. Subject to Section VIII of this
                Agreement (Disclaimers; Limitations; Waivers Of Liability), the
                arbitrator shall have authority to grant any form of appropriate
                relief, whether legal or equitable in nature, including specific
                performance.

                without regard to conflict of law’s provisions) regardless of
                your location except that Section X (Arbitration) of this
                Agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. For

                award or incidental to such arbitration or to compel
                arbitration, or if for any reason a claim proceeds in court
                rather than in arbitration, you hereby submit to the
                non-exclusive jurisdiction of the state and Federal courts
                sitting in Delaware, and agree that service of process in such
                arbitration or court proceedings shall be satisfactorily made
                upon a party if sent by certified, express or registered mail
                addressed to it at the address set forth in the books and

                by email to the email address provided by the relevant party to
                the Company in connection with its use of the Services. With
                respect to any Disputes not subject to informal dispute
                resolution or arbitration (as set forth above), you agree not to
                commence or prosecute any action in connection therewith other
                than in the state and federal courts located in Delaware and you

                jurisdiction and forum non conveniens with respect to, venue and
