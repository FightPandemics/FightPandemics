Upon returning home to Barcelona, he found he was unable to get help even though there were people who wanted to provide it. Telegram and WhatsApp groups were self-organizing in Manuel’s neighborhood, but without personally knowing anyone involved he could not ask them for assistance. Inspired by so many coming together, Manuel launched the project with one mission in mind: to ensure that others could connect in time.",
