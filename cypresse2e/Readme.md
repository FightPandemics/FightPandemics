**Style convention for writing tests:**

1. Variables naming convention: variables should be declared with a camelCase with a leading lowercase character example: requestHelpButton
2. Method names conventions: method should be declared with a camelCase with a leading lowercase character example: getOfferHelpButton()
3. Convention for naming files: should be declared with a camelCase with a leading lowercase character example: homePage.js
4. Convention for naming classes: should be declared with a PascalCase with a leading uppercase character example: HomePage
5. Set a state using cy.request example: for a logged in user. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50685302/page-object-pattern-in-cypress. It will create flake-free and fast tests.
6. Page Objects are defined in the elements/pages folder
7. Tests are defined in the integration/e2eTests

**How to generate mochawesome report:**

*For local:*

1. Make sure to `cd cypresse2e`.
2. Run `npm run test` to run all tests or run `npx cypress run --spec "cypress/integration/e2eTests/folderName/testName.spec.js"` to run an individual test - e.g (npm cypress run --spec "cypress/integration/e2eTests/footer/footer.spec.js").
3. After test(s) finishes, run `npm run report` to generate html report.
4. Right click on the 'mochawesome.html' file in the 'mochawesome-report' folder and select the 'Open Containing Folder' option. After the folder opens, double click on the html file to view the generated test report.
5. **Note**: If you are running an individual test and you want to delete the json files in the 'mochawesome-report' folder  generated from previous test runs to prevent them from showing up in the html, run `npm run pretest` before running a new test. 

*For docker-compose:*

1. Make sure to `cd cypresse2e`.
2. Run `docker-compose build cypress-e2e-tests` in initial setup.
3. Run `docker-compose run cypress-e2e-tests` to run all tests. (If you want to run individual tests, then it will need to be run locally).
4. After test(s) finishes, run `docker-compose run cypress-e2e-report` and the 'mochawesome html' report should generate.
5. Right click on the 'mochawesome.html' file in the 'mochawesome-report' folder and select the 'Open Containing Folder' option. After the folder opens, double click on the html file to view the generated test report.
