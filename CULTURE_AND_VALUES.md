# Culture and Values

## Optimism
Together we can achieve a better future. When humans unite with a purpose, amazing things can happen and remember that if you aren't an optimist, you are unlikely to step up and take responsibility for making things better. We understand things worth doing aren’t always easy. We are here to make a difference.

## **Do-ocracy**
Anyone can take any decision after they've first asked advice from people who will be affected and people that have shown expertise in what you are trying to achieve. If you want something done, DO IT and remember that actions always speak louder than words. If you see that something is wrong and you can't fix it, at least do your best and make suggestions on how to make them better. Remember to be pragmatic, don't reinvent the wheel, use what is freely available and improve it!!

## Commitment
We love autonomy and self-determination, individual commitment supports collective responsibility. We are creating this tool together. If we signup for a task, we expect to have it finished in the estimated time as we all depend on it. Diligently track towards goals, aim to exceed expectations, and always look for ways to improve. We get it, we are all busy and we have also other things to do, but overall engagement is important. This might mean jumping in online, attending meetings, recruiting and supporting new people, and participating in collaborative processes.

## Collaboration
1+1=3!! A group of self determined committed individuals that collaborate efficiently lead to great collective intelligence and will raise the team to new levels. We can add more value working together and bringing different skills across different teams to create an outcome that’s bigger than the sum of its parts. Collaboration does not mean involving everyone all the time and moving slow as a result. Focus on where we can create uniquely valuable products and services, rather than trying to do everything ourselves, and build on the work of others whenever we can.

## Communication
Communicate clearly, continuously, honestly, and respectfully. Document processes, decisions and progress along the way as we are a large decentralized volunteer group. Be transparent, make relevant information and context easily accessible so that everyone can be more efficient and effective. Talk about why we made a choice, not just what choices we made. Describe the hypotheses being tested by your work, and report results compared to expectations. Solicit feedback and suggestions as early as possible and as frequently as possible, to ensure that what we do and what we make fits the expectations.
